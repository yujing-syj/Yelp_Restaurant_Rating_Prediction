# Prediction of Austin Restaurants’ Rating


Hello! This is the final project in Python for MACS 30122 Computer Science with Social Science Applications 2 at The University of Chicago. Our project is: Prediction of Austin Restaurants’ Rating. 

The goal of our project is to help those who want to start a restaurant business in Austin to find the important factors that could affect the restaurant rating, and figure out the contributions of some social science features (population density, people’s reactions and feedback after visiting a restaurant) to the rating. 

Our team members are: Zhiyun Hu, Xin Li, Linhui Wu, Yujing Sun.

Here is the link for our presentation on how to run the code:

Instructions to run the code:

- Make sure to download the two dataset provided by Yelp(.json) in the same directory as the ipython notebook.     
- Make sure to run the notebook in python 3 environment. 
- Make sure all the libraries used in the notebook are installed in the local machine.     
- Run the notebook in the following sequense: 1) web_scraping.ipynb; 2)yelp_reviews_analysis.ipynb; 3)data_cleaning_and_regression.ipynb.


Files:

- web_scraping.ipynb: IPython notebook showing scraping from Web. tripadvisor and zipatlas.     
- yelp_reviews_analysis.ipynb: IPython notebook including reviews data clean and analysis.      
- data_cleaning_and_regression.ipynb: IPython notebook including data clean and analysis for building prediction model.
- positive-words.txt: Text file listed the positive words in reviews.
- negative-words.txt: Text file listed the negative words in reviews.
- csv: Three tables which are data of population density data, data of attraction number, and data of restaurants' information.
